# Contributing to INN

Thank you for considering a contribution! By submitting a pull request (PR) you agree to:

1. **License your contribution under GPL‑3.0** – the same license that covers the rest of the project.
2. Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) if we ever need one (we currently rely on the “implicit CLA” – your PR acceptance equals licensing under GPL‑3.0).
3. Follow our coding style guidelines (see `CODE_STYLE.md`).

We welcome bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and tests.
